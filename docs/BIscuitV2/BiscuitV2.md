Actions can include operations such as staking, swapping, or interacting with other contracts.

_This function increments the tokenId, mints a new ERC721 token to the specified address, stores the burn parameters, and executes a series of transactions._

#### Parameters

## ERC721

### Transfer

```solidity
event Transfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)
```

_Emitted when `tokenId` token is transferred from `from` to `to`._

### Approval

```solidity
event Approval(address owner, address approved, uint256 tokenId)
```

_Emitted when `owner` enables `approved` to manage the `tokenId` token._

### ApprovalForAll

```solidity
event ApprovalForAll(address owner, address operator, bool approved)
```

_Emitted when `owner` enables or disables (`approved`) `operator` to manage all of its assets._

### balanceOf

```solidity
function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256 balance)
```

_Returns the number of tokens in `owner`'s account._

### ownerOf

```solidity
function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address owner)
```

\_Returns the owner of the `tokenId` token.

Requirements:

-   `tokenId` must exist.\_

### safeTransferFrom

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes data) external
```

\_Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`.

Requirements:

-   `from` cannot be the zero address.
-   `to` cannot be the zero address.
-   `tokenId` token must exist and be owned by `from`.
-   If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.
-   If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received}, which is called upon
    a safe transfer.

Emits a {Transfer} event.\_

### safeTransferFrom

```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external
```

\_Safely transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`, checking first that contract recipients
are aware of the ERC721 protocol to prevent tokens from being forever locked.

Requirements:

-   `from` cannot be the zero address.
-   `to` cannot be the zero address.
-   `tokenId` token must exist and be owned by `from`.
-   If the caller is not `from`, it must have been allowed to move this token by either {approve} or
    {setApprovalForAll}.
-   If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement {IERC721Receiver-onERC721Received}, which is called upon
    a safe transfer.

Emits a {Transfer} event.\_

### transferFrom

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external
```

\_Transfers `tokenId` token from `from` to `to`.

WARNING: Note that the caller is responsible to confirm that the recipient is capable of receiving ERC721
or else they may be permanently lost. Usage of {safeTransferFrom} prevents loss, though the caller must
understand this adds an external call which potentially creates a reentrancy vulnerability.

Requirements:

-   `from` cannot be the zero address.
-   `to` cannot be the zero address.
-   `tokenId` token must be owned by `from`.
-   If the caller is not `from`, it must be approved to move this token by either {approve} or {setApprovalForAll}.

Emits a {Transfer} event.\_

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) external
```

\_Gives permission to `to` to transfer `tokenId` token to another account.
The approval is cleared when the token is transferred.

Only a single account can be approved at a time, so approving the zero address clears previous approvals.

Requirements:

-   The caller must own the token or be an approved operator.
-   `tokenId` must exist.

Emits an {Approval} event.\_

### setApprovalForAll

```solidity
function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) external
```

\_Approve or remove `operator` as an operator for the caller.
Operators can call {transferFrom} or {safeTransferFrom} for any token owned by the caller.

Requirements:

-   The `operator` cannot be the address zero.

Emits an {ApprovalForAll} event.\_

### getApproved

```solidity
function getApproved(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address operator)
```

\_Returns the account approved for `tokenId` token.

Requirements:

-   `tokenId` must exist.\_

### isApprovedForAll

```solidity
function isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator) external view returns (bool)
```

\_Returns if the `operator` is allowed to manage all of the assets of `owner`.

See {setApprovalForAll}\_
